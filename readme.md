# homebrew-tap

[日本語readme](readme.ja.md)

Currently, I have placed some small scripts that I created myself.

## Usage

0. Add this repository as a tap: `brew tap aromarious/tap`
1. Install with `brew install <formula>`

## Available Formulae

### [`display-rotate`](https://github.com/aromarious/display-rotate)

A command-line tool to rotate the specified display by 90 degrees. I use BetterTouchTool to assign 🌐R for easily switching the orientation of my mobile display. Thanks to [`displayplacer`](https://github.com/jakehilborn/displayplacer)

### [`clear-notifications`](https://github.com/aromarious/clear-notifications)

A command-line tool to clear all notifications on Mac. I also use BetterTouchTool to assign ⇧🌐N for this. Tested on macOS Sequoia 15.2 (24C101).

**Note**: As it is written in AppleScript, its compatibility in future macOS versions is uncertain.
